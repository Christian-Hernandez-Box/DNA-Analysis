This project analyzes DNA sequences to determine if a suspect's DNA matches a criminal profile. The analysis is based on matching specific codons in the DNA sequence.

## Project Structure

* main.py: Contains the main logic for reading DNA files, extracting codons, matching DNA, and determining if a suspect is a criminal.
